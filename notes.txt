Incoming has a quantity and shelf life.
Incoming should be dedicated to fulfill outgoing if there isn't enough existing, fresh product (credits) to cover it.
Entry should have knowledge of existing credits.
Entry should always use credits to fulfill outgoing when possible.
If an entry absolutely needs credits to fulfill its outgoing it should make previous entries aware of that (debits).
This can lead to a cascading pattern (debits creating debits creating debits...).
Credits do not cascade.
Do not debit a previous entry into negative availability.
